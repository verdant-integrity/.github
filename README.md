# Verdant Integrity

**Operational technology for UK renewable energy.**

We build dashboards, integrations, and compliance systems for asset owners and O&M teams — the kind of tools we wished existed when we were managing the assets ourselves.

---

## What We Do

Renewable energy operations generate mountains of data across disconnected systems. SCADA, CMMS, weather feeds, inspection apps, spreadsheets — none of them talk to each other, and nobody has time to log into five platforms to understand what's happening.

We fix that.

→ **Real-time dashboards** that unify SCADA, sensors, meters, and weather into a single view
→ **Inspection workflows** with GIS integration and automatic issue tracking
→ **Compliance frameworks** that prove due diligence to regulators and investors
→ **Control system reviews** for operational resilience and security posture
→ **Emergency response planning** with GIS-mapped routes and real retrieval times
→ **System integrations** that connect your existing platforms without vendor lock-in

## Built by Practitioners

This isn't a software company that read about SCADA in a whitepaper.

Verdant Integrity was founded by an engineer with 20 years managing operational assets across renewables, defence, nuclear, and critical infrastructure. The frustration of working with disconnected systems, clunky interfaces, and reports that nobody read led to building something better.

## Open Source

We believe in open-source tools for accelerating the energy transition. The renewable sector shouldn't need six-figure proprietary platforms to get visibility into their own data.

Where we can, we'll share tools, templates, and learnings here.
